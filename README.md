# Humaun Music (NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION)

## Current state:
- A functional, static, single-page web app for listening to music.
- In the current version, the hard-coded HTML, CSS & JS are responsible for fetching files.
- That provides (in my view) a basic prototype in a relatively short period of time.
- All the music is included here.

## Works:
- The Play button requires selection of a genre.
- It starts playing from a start of the genre-playlist
- There are controls for
    - changing volume with a slider
    - mute / unmute
    - selecting individul pieces
- The playlist automatically loops
- There's an option to search for other music and / or videos
- The search will redirect to https://www.youtube.com/
