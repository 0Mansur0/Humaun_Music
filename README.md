# Humaun Music.
## NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION
Current state:
- A simple static web page for listening to music.
- In the current version, the hard-coded HTML, CSS & JS are responsible for fetching files.
- The reason was the tight time and the need for a basic prototype.
- This static web page relies on internet connection to fetch some fonts and icons.
- All the music is included here.


## Works:
- The Play button requires selection of a genre.
- There's an option to select genre which will automatically start to play the songs in the category.
- The search will redirect to https://www.youtube.com/ search
